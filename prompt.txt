Project Requirements: React Native App with Frappe Framework Integration

I want to create a React Native app integrated with Frappe Framework. Here are the detailed requirements:

1. APP FLOW:
- When the app is first installed, the user should enter the URL of their Frappe Framework site
- After URL setup, show a login page where users enter their username and password
- Upon successful login, navigate to the employee dashboard

2. FRAPPE BACKEND - EMPLOYEE DOCTYPE CUSTOMIZATION:

Add three custom fields to the Employee doctype:

a) Allow ESS (Checkbox)
   - Field Type: Check
   - Field Name: custom_allow_ess
   - Label: "Allow Employee Self Service"
   - Description: When checked, this employee can login to the mobile app

- User enters username and regular Frappe password on login screen
- Backend should verify:
  * If the employee has "Allow ESS" checkbox checked

4. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Only employees with "Allow ESS" enabled can login

5. TECHNICAL STACK:
- Frontend: React Native
- Backend: Frappe Framework
- Authentication: Frappe's built-in authentication + custom validation
